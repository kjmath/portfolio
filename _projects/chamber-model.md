excerpt: "A code example for a rocket combustion chamber chemical equilibrium solver. The model is end-to-end differentiable. Combustion temperature and products are solved for by minimizing their Gibb's free energy subject to conservation of mass and enthalpy. Uses modern python code quality practices (uv, ruff, pyright, GitHub Actions)."
