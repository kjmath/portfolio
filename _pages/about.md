I’m Kelly Mathesius – a Research & Development Engineer at Formlabs with a PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT. I currently develop models to understand and optimize stereolithography printing process physics, as well as query, analyze, and visualize print metric data to drive print algorithm development. 

I have a multi-disciplinary skillset in computational modeling, scientific software, optimization of constrained systems, data analysis, manufacturing, and technical communication. Check out some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
