I'm Kelly Mathesius - an engineer, maker, and PhD Candidate in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, graduating in May 2023. I currently do research in high-temperature materials, solid rocket propulsion, rocket exhaust plume radiant emission, and computational optimization of aircraft design. 

I have demonstrated project experience in design, fabrication, additive manufacturing, modelling and optimization of constrained physical systems, scientific software, and technical communication. I enjoy working on challenging, multi-disciplinary projects in emerging technologies.
